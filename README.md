I'm Meng (Maggie) Tian, a full-stack software engineer based in Seattle, WA, with a background in web development, data science, and machine learning.

## üòÑ About Me

- I earned my bachelor's degree from Tsinghua University in 2012, renowned as China's top university and a leading engineering school. During my time there, I received rigorous training in mathematics, statistics, and programming. Influenced by the university's engineering ethos, I often used various scripting languages for economic modeling and programming tools for data mining.

-  My thirst for knowledge led me to pursue a Ph.D. in business from Baruch College, City University of New York. Following this, I worked as a research engineer and accomplished two successful publications. My research primarily focuses on coding and algorithmic development for financial trading, and pioneering the integration of machine learning into financial research.

- As a dedicated coder and hobbyist programmer, I finally took the plunge into a full-fledged engineering career, completing App Academy's intensive six-month coding bootcamp in 2023. This experience significantly expanded my web development skills, allowing me to transform business insights into tangible, data-driven solutions ‚Äî a truly satisfying journey.

 - I aspire to build intelligent, user-friendly products that leverage data-driven insights and cutting-edge machine learning. With expertise in modern web technologies and a data-centric mindset, I'm now fully dedicated to a software engineering career that allows me to utilize my diverse skills to the fullest.

- Let's connect and create something amazing together!
